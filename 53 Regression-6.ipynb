    "The key steps involved in building an end-to-end web application, from development to deployment on the cloud are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Requirements gathering: Identify the needs and goals of the application and define the user requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. System Design: Create a high-level architecture design that outlines the components, data models, and data flows of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Development: Write the code and develop the application, implementing the system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testing: Test the application to ensure it meets the user requirements and is free of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Deployment: Deploy the application to the cloud service provider, which can be done using various cloud deployment tools such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google App Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Monitoring and maintenance: Monitor the application to ensure it's running correctly and perform maintenance tasks such as scaling, updating, and backing up the application as needed."

    "### Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "The main difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting is that traditional hosting typically involves hosting a website or application on a physical server that is managed and maintained by the hosting provider, while cloud hosting involves hosting the application on a virtual server that is part of a larger network of servers managed by the cloud provider. Cloud hosting is more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective than traditional hosting, as it allows users to pay only for the resources they use and easily scale up or down as needed"
