    "## Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with  an example. \n",
    " \n",
    "The **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** and **Probability Density Function (PDF)** are mathematical functions used to describe the distribution of a random variable. The PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of each possible outcome. The PDF is used for continuous random variables and gives the probability density at each possible value.\n",

    "The **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)** is a function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. It is the integral of the PDF. The CDF is used to calculate probabilities for continuous random variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the same normal distribution as in Q1. The CDF for a normal distribution gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. If we want to find the probability that the time to complete a task is less than or equal to 10 minutes, we would calculate the CDF at 10 minutes."

    "The normal distribution is commonly used as a model for situations where the data is continuous and symmetric around the mean. Examples include the distribution of heights or weights of people, IQ scores, and the amount of rainfall in a particular area. The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean and standard deviation, which determine the center and spread of the distribution."

    "The **Bernoulli Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution with two possible outcomes, usually labeled as success or failure. It is used to model situations where there is only one trial with a binary outcome. An example would be flipping a coin to get heads or tails. The difference between the Bernoulli Distribution and the Binomial Distribution is that the Bernoulli Distribution models a single trial, while the Binomial Distribution models a fixed number of independent trials with the same probability of success"
