    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL). The main differences between the two types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data structure: SQL databases are based on the relational model, which means that data is stored in tables with predefined relationships between them. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are based on a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, and graph-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query language: SQL databases use the SQL language to interact with the data, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages depending on the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data across multiple servers, while SQL databases can be more limited in terms of scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility: NoSQL databases are generally more flexible than SQL databases because they can handle unstructured and semi-structured data more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data consistency: SQL databases are generally better at enforcing data consistency, while NoSQL databases can sometimes have eventual consistency, which means that changes to the data may take some time to propagate across all nodes in a distributed system."
