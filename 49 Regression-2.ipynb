    "### Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    "The R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, and 1 means that the model perfectly explains all the variance. R2 is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance of the dependent variable. Mathematically, R2 = 1 - (SSres / SStot), where SSres is the sum of squared residuals and SStot is the total sum of squares."

    "### Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is a modification of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary independent variables that do not improve the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared is calculated as (1 - (1-R2)*(n-1)/(n-p-1)), where n is the sample size and p is the number of independent variables."

    "### Q3. When is it more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared?\n",
    " It is more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. R-squared may increase as more independent variables are added to the model, even if they do not improve the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared accounts for this by penalizing models with too many independent variables."

    "### Q4. What are RMSE, MSE, and MAE in the context of regression analysis? How are these metrics calculated, and what do they represent?\n",
    "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models. RMSE is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values."

    "The advantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE are that they provide a quantitative measure of the performance of the model and can be easily interpreted. The disadvantage is that they are sensitive to outliers and may not reflect the true performance of the model if there are extreme values in the data."

    "### Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that forces the model coefficients to be small or zero. Lasso differs from Ridge regularization in that it can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, effectively eliminating some features from the model. Lasso is more appropriate when there are many irrelevant features in the data."

    "### Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "Regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature. For example, in Ridge regression, the penalty term is the sum of the squared coefficients, which forces the model to shrink the coefficients towards zero. This can prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and making it more generalizable to new data."

    "The limitations of regularized linear models are that they may not always be appropriate for all datasets, particularly those with a small number of features or a linear relationship between the features and target variable. Additionally, they may not be able to capture nonlinear relationships between the features and target variable."
