    "### Q1. A company conducted a survey of its employees and found that 70% of the employees use the company's health insurance plan, while 40% of the employees who use the plan are smokers. What is the probability that an employee is a smoker given that he/she uses the health insurance plan?\n",
    "The probability that an employee is a smoker given that he/she uses the health insurance plan is 40%/70% = 4/7 or approximately 0.57."

    "### Q2. What is the difference between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes?\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes is suitable for binary classification problems where the features are binary (either 0 or 1). Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for multi-class classification problems where the features are discrete (e.g., counts)."
