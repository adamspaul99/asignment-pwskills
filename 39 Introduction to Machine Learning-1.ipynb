    "The importance of train, test, and validation split lies in ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on new, unseen data. If the model is evaluated on the same data it was trained on, it may overfit to the training data and not generalize well to new data. By using a validation set to tune the hyperparameters and a test set to evaluate the final model, we can ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on new, unseen data, and that it can generalize well to new data."

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns and structures in the data and identifying data points that do not fit these patterns or structures. Anomalies or outliers in the data are often defined as data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to identify these anomalies by clustering the data points based on their similarity or by identifying data points that are far from the center of the cluster."
