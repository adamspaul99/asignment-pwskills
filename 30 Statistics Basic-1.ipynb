    "\n",
    "**Explanation** Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the average of all values in a dataset, the median is the middle value when the values are sorted in order, and the mode is the most frequent value. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and may not be representative of the dataset if the distribution is skewed. The median is less sensitive to extreme values and is a better measure of central tendency when the distribution is skewed. The mode is useful for describing nominal data."
