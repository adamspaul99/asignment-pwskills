    "### Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a type of feature selection method that uses statistical tests to evaluate the relevance of individual features. It works by selecting a subset of features based on their scores obtained from a statistical measure, such as correlation, mutual information, or chi-square test. The features are then ranked according to their scores, and a threshold is set to select the top-ranked features."

    "### Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method, unlike the Filter method, uses a machine learning algorithm to select features that are most predictive of the target variable. It works by creating subsets of features and training a model on each subset. The performance of the model is then evaluated, and the subset of features with the best performance is selected. This process is repeated until the optimal set of features is found."

    "### Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded feature selection methods involve incorporating feature selection into the process of model training. Common techniques used in Embedded feature selection include Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net. These methods apply regularization to the model, which penalizes features with low coefficients, leading to automatic feature selection."

    "### Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main drawbacks of the Filter method is that it does not consider the interaction between features. It assumes that each feature is independent of others, which may not be true in some cases. Additionally, the threshold for selecting features is often arbitrary, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant features or the exclusion of important ones."

    "The Filter method is suitable when dealing with a large number of features and limited computational resources. It is also useful when the relationship between features and the target variable is linear or additive."

Features that have high scores are then selected, and a threshold is set to select the top-ranked features."
