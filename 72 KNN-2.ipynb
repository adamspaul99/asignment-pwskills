    "The choice between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in certain ways. Euclidean distance is sensitive to differences in scale between features, as it considers both magnitude and direction. Therefore, if the features have different scales, it may dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased results. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is less sensitive to scale differences since it only considers magnitudes. In cases where scale differences are significant or irrelevant features exist, Manhattan distance may perform better."
