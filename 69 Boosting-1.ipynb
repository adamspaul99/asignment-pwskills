    "\n",
    "Boosting is a machine learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. It is an iterative process where each weak learner is trained sequentially, and more emphasis is given to the misclassified samples in each iteration. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all weak learners."

    "Boosting works by sequentially training weak learners and adjusting the weights of the training examples. The process can be summarized as follows:\n",

    "1. Initially, each training example is assigned an equal weight.\n",
    "2. A weak learner (e.g., a decision tree with limited depth) is trained on the training data.\n",

    "4. Another weak learner is trained on the updated weights, giving more attention to the misclassified examples.\n",
    "5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "6. The predictions of all weak learners are combined using a weighted voting scheme to form the final prediction."

Stronger emphasis is given to the predictions of weak learners that perform well on the training data and misclassify the samples. The final prediction is made by summing or averaging the weighted predictions of all weak learners."
