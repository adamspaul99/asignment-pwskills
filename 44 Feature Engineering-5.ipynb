    "The main difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding is that Ordinal Encoding assigns a rank to the categories, whereas Label Encoding simply converts each category to a numeric label\n",
    "\n",
    "One might choose Ordinal Encoding over Label Encoding when the categories have a natural order or hierarchy. For instance, when encoding grades such as A, B, C, D, and F, Ordinal Encoding can be a better choice as it preserves the rank order of the grades."

    "### Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where each category is ranked based on its relationship with the target variable. For example, if the target variable is \"price,\" and we have a categorical variable \"color,\" we can rank the colors from 1 to n based on their mean price. The category with the highest mean price will be assigned a higher rank, and the category with the lowest mean price will be assigned the lowest rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a strong correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable. It can help capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, which can lead to better model performance."

    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It indicates how much two variables change together. Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps us understand how two variables are related to each other. If two variables have a high positive covariance, it means that they tend to increase or decrease together. If two variables have a high negative covariance, it means that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease."
