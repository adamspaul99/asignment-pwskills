Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. These measures provide a numerical summary of how much the values in a dataset vary from each other.\n",

Skewness can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive skewness indicates that the tail of the distribution is longer on the positive side, while a negative skewness indicates that the tail of the distribution is longer on the negative side.\n"
