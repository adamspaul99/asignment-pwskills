    "### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make a prediction. It is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks."

    "### Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by creating multiple decision trees based on random subsets of the training data and random subsets of the features. This process helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve the generalization performance."

    "### Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average of all the predictions (in regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (in classification tasks). This ensemble of decision trees helps to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions."

    "### Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "The hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include the number of decision trees in the ensemble, the maximum depth of each tree, the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node."

    "### Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor creates multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions, while Decision Tree Regressor creates a single decision tree. Random Forest Regressor also reduces the risk of overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor."

    "### Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "The advantages of Random Forest Regressor include its ability to handle high-dimensional data, its resistance to overfitting, and its ability to provide feature importance rankings. The disadvantages include its relatively slower training time compared to simpler models, and the potential difficulty in interpreting the results."
