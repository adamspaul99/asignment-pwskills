    "### Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century British statistician."

    "### Q3. How is Bayes' theorem used in practice?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem has numerous applications in many fields, including statistics, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and more. In practice, Bayes' theorem is used to update beliefs or probabilities based on new evidence or data, and to make predictions or decisions based on those probabilities."

    "What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is based on conditional probability, which is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Bayes' theorem provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of one event given another event and some prior knowledge or information."

    "How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\n",
    "The choice of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data available. There are three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. Gaussian Naive Bayes is suitable for continuous data, Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for discrete data, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes is suitable for binary data."
