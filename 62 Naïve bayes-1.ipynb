    "The type of Naive Bayes classifier to use depends on the nature of the problem and the type of data available. The three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers are Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, each suited for different types of data and problem scenarios"
